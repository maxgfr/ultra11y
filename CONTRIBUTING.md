# Contributing to ultra11y

Thanks for helping make the web accessible everywhere. ultra11y's engine is keyed on
**WCAG 2.2 Level AA** — the worldwide standard. Country-specific standards (France's
RGAA, the US Section 508, the EU's EN 301 549, Canada/Ontario's AODA, …) ship as
**standards packs**: small, self-contained JSON files that map a national standard's
criteria onto WCAG success criteria. Adding your country is a single PR.

## Repo basics

- Node ≥ 22.18, pnpm. `pnpm install`, then:
  - `pnpm test` — Vitest suite
  - `pnpm typecheck` — `tsc --noEmit`
  - `pnpm lint` / `pnpm lint:fix` — Biome
  - `pnpm run build` — bundle the engine (tsup → `scripts/ultra11y.mjs`, mirrored into the skill)
  - `pnpm run check:build` — verify the bundle is reproducible and the skill bundle is intact
- The engine is **zero runtime dependencies** and **install-free** (`npx skills add maxgfr/ultra11y`).
  Anything you add must keep that true: data is bundled via static `import`, never read from disk at runtime.

## Adding a country standards pack

A pack is `src/data/standards/<key>.json` (plus an optional `<key>.glossary.json`) registered in
`src/standards/registry.ts`. RGAA is the reference example — read `src/data/standards/rgaa.json` and
`scripts/build-pack-rgaa.mjs` first.

### 1. Author the pack JSON

Shape (see `src/standards/types.ts` for the authoritative types):

```jsonc
{
  "key": "section508",                       // unique slug; MAY NOT be "wcag" (reserved core key)
  "name": "Section 508",
  "fullName": "Revised Section 508 (US)",
  "org": "U.S. Access Board",
  "country": "US",
  "baseVersion": "2018",
  "wcagVersion": "2.0",                       // the WCAG version this standard incorporates
  "locales": ["en"],
  "defaultLocale": "en",                      // REQUIRED; every LocaleString must carry it
  "license": "Public Domain (US Government work)",
  "source": "https://www.access-board.gov/ict/",
  "attribution": "Revised Section 508 — U.S. Access Board",
  "idPattern": "^E?\\d+\\.\\d+(\\.\\d+)?$",   // regex your criterion ids match
  "themes": [{ "number": 1, "name": { "en": "…" }, "count": 1 }],
  "criteria": [
    {
      "id": "E205.4",
      "theme": 1,
      "title": { "en": "Accessibility Standard (WCAG)" },
      "titlePlain": { "en": "Accessibility Standard (WCAG)" },
      "wcag": ["1.1.1", "1.4.3", "4.1.2"]     // bare WCAG SC ids this criterion maps to
    }
  ]
}
```

Rules of the road:
- **`title`/`name` are `LocaleString`s** (`{ "en": "…", "fr": "…" }`). The pack's `defaultLocale`
  is mandatory on each; **English is strongly recommended** for worldwide readability. A national
  standard that is genuinely single-language (like RGAA, fr-only) is fine.
- **`wcag` holds bare 3-segment SC ids** (`"1.4.3"`, not `"1.4.3 Contrast (Minimum) (AA)"`).
- A criterion may map to a WCAG SC outside the 2.2 **AA** core (e.g. an AAA SC, or 4.1.1 Parsing
  which 2.2 removed). That's allowed — it simply won't receive an engine verdict and shows as
  *not applicable* in the derived report. Don't invent SC ids; every id you cite that IS in the
  core must resolve (`pnpm test` checks this).
- The pack does **not** carry engine rules or automatability. Those live in the WCAG core
  (`scripts/build-standards.mjs`); your pack only declares the criterion↔WCAG-SC mapping.
- Pick a redistributable source/licence and record it in `license` + `attribution`, the way the
  RGAA pack cites DINUM / Licence Ouverte Etalab 2.0. If the official text isn't redistributable,
  derive only the public criterion list + WCAG mapping and cite the source.

If your standard has an official machine-readable source, add a `scripts/build-pack-<key>.mjs`
(model it on `scripts/build-pack-rgaa.mjs`) that fetches/transforms it, and vendor a pinned copy
of the source under `scripts/vendor/<key>/` so the build is reproducible offline.

### 2. Register it

In `src/standards/registry.ts`, add a static import + one `register(...)` line (static imports are
required so the bundler inlines your pack — no runtime filesystem/glob):

```ts
import section508 from "../data/standards/section508.json";
// …
register(section508 as unknown as StandardPack, {} /* or your glossary */);
```

### 3. Add tests

Extend `tests/packs.test.ts` (or add `tests/packs-<key>.test.ts`): assert the header, that every
criterion carries the default locale, that ids match `idPattern`, and that every cited in-core SC
resolves via `hasSC`. Then `pnpm test` + `pnpm typecheck` + `pnpm lint` must be green.

### 4. Regenerate derived docs + bundle

```bash
node scripts/build-standards.mjs       # re-seed WCAG techniques from packs (deterministic)
node scripts/ultra11y.mjs criteria --generate > skills/ultra11y/references/criteria.md  # if applicable
pnpm run build && pnpm run check:build
```

### Using a pack

```bash
node scripts/ultra11y.mjs audit "src/**/*.html" --out audits        # WCAG-keyed audit (canonical)
node scripts/ultra11y.mjs report --in audits/audit-latest.json --standard section508
node scripts/ultra11y.mjs criteria --standard section508 --theme 1
```

### Runtime packs, guidance & AI ingestion

You don't have to ship a pack to use one. The same `StandardPack` JSON can be loaded
**at runtime** — no rebuild — with `--pack ./pack.json` (a file, or a directory holding
`pack.json` + optional `glossary.json`/`guidance.json`) or a `.ultra11yrc.json`. Whichever
route you take, the **same validator** runs first, and the `pack` command is the gate:

```bash
node scripts/ultra11y.mjs pack scaffold > pack.json                  # a blank, valid skeleton
node scripts/ultra11y.mjs pack check pack.json --guidance guidance.json   # fail-loud gate
```

`pack check` is the **anti-hallucination gate**: a fabricated SC (not a real WCAG SC), a
guidance entry whose `criterionId` doesn't resolve, or an unparseable code example fails
it. This is what makes **AI-assisted ingestion** safe — point the agent at an external
rule source (e.g. the RGAA SocialGouv/etalab rule packs), have it draft the pack + a
**guidance** dataset (concrete before/after implementation rules; see
`skills/ultra11y/references/guidance.md`) + proposed detectors, then iterate against
`pack check` until green. A deterministic fast-path scaffolder lives at
`scripts/import-pack.mjs`. Honesty rule for detectors: only add an engine rule for a
pattern that is statically decidable **and** maps to an SC in the WCAG 2.2 AA core;
everything else is guidance + residual risk, never silently conforming.

## PR checklist

- [ ] Pack JSON validates; ids match `idPattern`; every in-core SC resolves.
- [ ] Registered in `src/standards/registry.ts` (static import).
- [ ] Tests added; `pnpm test`, `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm lint` green.
- [ ] `pnpm run check:build` green (bundle reproducible).
- [ ] Source + licence recorded in `license` / `attribution`; `NOTICE` updated if you vendor source text.
- [ ] One conventional-commit (`feat: add <country> standards pack`); no unrelated changes.

## Engine rules & WCAG core

Changes to the static rules, the WCAG dataset, or automatability classes are bigger and standard-wide.
Open an issue first. The WCAG 2.2 dataset is derived from the W3C source (https://github.com/w3c/wcag)
by `scripts/build-standards.mjs` — never hand-edit `src/data/wcag.json`.
