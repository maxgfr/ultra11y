# Dev/CI image: build, typecheck and test the engine without installing Node,
# pnpm or any dependency on the host — everything stays inside the container, so
# `make clean` (or `docker compose down --rmi local`) leaves the machine spotless.
# This is NOT the dynamic-tier image (that one is docker/Dockerfile, browser+axe).
